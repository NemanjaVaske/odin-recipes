    <h3>Nice crispy chicken, with tangy taste. It is best if bone-in chicken pieces used.</h2>
    <p>Best chicken, easy to make.</p>
    <p>Delicious and health.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. <br> Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, <br> it is done.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. <br> Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. <br> Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. <br> (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)</li>
    </ol>
